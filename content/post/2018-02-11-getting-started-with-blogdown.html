<p>For a while now, I’ve been thinking about starting a “data science-y” blog. In the aftermath of <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/">rstudio::conf</a> this year, I finally decided it was time to act on those thoughts, and put something out there. And <a href="https://twitter.com/xieyihui">Yihui Xie</a>’s <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><strong>blogdown</strong> book</a> seemed like a great place to start.</p>

<p>Since most of my content would likely revolve around statistics and <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, writing posts directly in <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> was basically a requirement for my blogging framework. I also wanted to have a modern looking site without too much hassle, but while still being able to customize some things here and there, if (and when) I felt like it.</p>
<p>Turns out, using <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown"><strong>blogdown</strong></a> with <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> to interface with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> (a powerful static site generator with a strong templating system) can provide just that. Combined with deploying the site on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> via a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> repo, the whole pipeline provides an excellent structure for me to keep working on key data science skills that come up less often in my daily life as a biostatistician: R Markdown, and version control; while having a central location to organize my thoughts in.</p>
<p>Getting started was… fairly straightforward, yet not quite as simple as I had perhaps hoped.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It took me the better part of a Sunday, even with having familiarized myself with the topic a bit beforehand; and I ended up having to realize that, even if it’s not perfect, it would be better to get started with <em>something</em> rather than getting everything <em>just</em> the way I wanted it, and taking <strong>forever</strong> at it. Perhaps I’ll cover the process in more detail in future posts.</p>
<p>Right now though, I’m excited to get started with some R topics. After hearing that <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham">Hadley Wickham</a> is working on a <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/">second edition of his Advanced R book</a>, I’ve been going over the material again – and having a great time with it. So expect posts coming up in the near future, where I work through some of the problems included in the book!<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
