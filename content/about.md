# Me

I'm a recently graduated statistician from Finland, excited about maths, data science, and R. I currently work as a biostatistician in the R&D department at [Orion Corporation](https://www.orion.fi/en).

# Site

This site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) R package by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name). The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme).
