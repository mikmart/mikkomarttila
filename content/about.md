# Me

I'm a recently graduated statistician from Finland, excited about maths, data science, and R. I currently work as a biostatistician in the R&D department at [Orion Corporation](https://www.orion.fi/en).

In my spare time, I'm quite active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4550695/mikko-marttila), and occasionally work on some personal R package projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/mikmart).

# Site

This site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) R package by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name). The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme).
