# Me

I'm a statistician from Finland, excited about maths, data science, and R. I currently work as a data scientist in the R&D department at [Orion Corporation](https://www.orion.fi/en).

In my spare time, I'm quite active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4550695/mikko-marttila), and occasionally work on some personal projects (mostly R packages) on [GitHub](https://github.com/mikmart).

# Site

This site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) via [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown). The theme is [Hello Friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend).
